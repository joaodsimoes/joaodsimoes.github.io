							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/olx-banner.jpg" alt="" /></span>

							<h2>Intro</h2>
							<p>
							OLX is, without a doubt, the biggest online marketplace in Portugal, thousands of items are posted up for sale everyday.<br>
							People sometimes meet up in person to exchange money for the item they're buying, other times they do a wire transfer before recieving the product. <br>
							And as is custumary with any online marketplace, scammers try their best to gain a quick buck by scamming people. <br>
							This is what this extensions plans to minimize. By creating a system that rewards trustworhy practices and punishes unprofessionalism, customers will be more aware 
							of who they're making business with and what their past history entails.
							</p>
						<h2>How it works</h2>
							<p>
								Upon visiting a user's page, the extension icon will lit up and you'll be able to click on it. <br>
								As so: <br>
								<img src="images/olx_reviews.jpg" class= "center">
								<br>
								Upon opening, you'll be greeted with user statistics, how many people have reviewed him/her and the average of said reviews. <br>
								Here, we can see that the username JtZH has been reviewed 2 times and has an average score of 4 stars. <br>
								Each IP adress can only vote once for the same user. This is to avoid spam.<br>
								To Leave a review, you write about your experience with the user and then select how many stars to rate him with. <br>
								If you try to leave a review without any text, a message will pop up:<br> 
								<img src="images/olx_reviews-text.jpg" class= "center">
								<br>
								You can also press the view reviews button and the user reviews will pop up: <br>
